This Flutter app displays the top 100 albums based on the iTunes API. 

## Feature - WebView to be able to listen music

What is a music app without ability to listen to music?

I have implemented a web view to allow users to browse songs from top 100 albums.
When user taps on the album from the top 100 list, the songs are listed in a WebView.
